# Social_Network_Analysis_GraphFrame

Reddit dataset is analysed using PySpark GraphFrame using queries and algorithms. The following queries are answered:

a. Top 5 nodes with highest outdegree and count of outgoing edges:
b. Top 5 nodes with the highest indegree and count of incoming edges:
c. PageRank for each of the nodes and output the top 5 nodes with the highest PageRank values:
d. Run the connected components algorithm on it and find the top 5 components with the largest number of nodes.
e. Run the triangle counts algorithm on each of the vertices and output the top 5 vertices with the largest triangle count:
